Title: "Gene Selection Using Hybrid Multi-Objective\rCuckoo Search Algorithm With Evolutionary\rOperators for Cancer Microarray Data"
ShortSummary: The article presents a hybrid multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm for gene selection from cancer microarray data. The algorithm, inspired by the brood parasitism and LÃ©vy flights of cuckoo birds, incorporates mutation and crossover operators to improve the search ability and diversity of solutions. It addresses the challenge of analyzing and selecting relevant genes with maximum classification accuracy from high-dimensional and noisy data sets. The algorithm uses a Pareto optimal archive for multi-objective optimization, aiming to maximize classification performance while minimizing the number of selected genes. Tested on seven publicly available and high-dimensional cancer microarray data sets, the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms, selecting fewer significant genes.
